## Introduction

### biology
biology is the study of life


biosphere $$$\to$$$ ecosystems $$$\to$$$ communities $$$\to$$$ communities $$$\to$$$ populations $$$\to$$$ organisms $$$\to$$$ organs&organ systems $$$\to$$$ tissues $$$\to$$$ cells $$$\to$$$ organelles $$$\to$$$ molecules $$$\to$$$ atoms


### life

- order
- growth & development
- reproduction
- evolution
- homeostasis
- metabolism
- behavior


mule? virus? computer virus? fire?

`All life is made up of cells;
all cells are derived from other cels.`


### the chemistry of life
All chemicals works in different ways.


### elements, atoms & molecules
1. elements in life
	- `O, C, H, N`
	- `Ca, P, K, S, Na, Cl, Mg`
	- other
2. atoms, nucleus / electron cloud, protons / neutrons / electrons, isotopes
3. ions, valence shell, bonds/IMFs, electronegativity



## Basic Molecules of Life

### water
- most required substance
- 70~95% of cells
- makes the earth habitable
- 4 important properties
	- cohesive behavior
	- ability to moderate temperature
	- expansion upon freezing (make it possible for aquatic lives to survive)
	- versatility as a solvent (`hydrophilic/hydrophobic`)
	
### carbon basis (Organic)
- carbon can link other elements/groups  in with 4 bonds
(`hydrocarbon`, `functional group`)
- 4 main organics

### lipids
- hydrophobic
- `fats` (saturated/unsaturated)
- `phospholipids`
	- hydrophilic head (contact w/ water environment external&internal)
	- hydrophobic tails (@center of `bilayer`, not so easy for water to pass through)
- `steroids`
	- e.g. cholesterol

`polymers/monomers`


### carbohydrates
- `monosaccharides`
	- e.g. glucose, fructose
- `polysaccharides`
	- starch, glycogen, cellulose, chitin

### proteins
- amino acid
	- 20 amino acid monomers
	- $$$NH_2CHRCOOH$$$
	- essential amino acid
- diversity in protein function
	- enzymatic
	- defensive
	- storage
	- transport
	- hormonal
	- receptor
	- contractile & motor
	- structural

- complexity of protein structure (4 levels)
	- primary structure (`single chain`)
	- secondary structure (`alpha helix / pleated sheet`)
	- tertiary structure (`polypeptide`)
	- quaternary structure (`transthyretin`)

### nucleic acids
- nucleic acid: `phosphate group + sugar + nitrogenous base`
- DNA nitrogenous bases: 
	- A(adenine), T(thymine), C(cytosine), G(guanine)
	- pairing: `A & T, C & G`
		- size
		- H-bond pairing
- DNA $$$\to$$$ mRNA
	- [A, T, C, G] $$$\to$$$ [U, A, G, C]
- processes:
	- `replication`: DNA $$$\to$$$ DNA (DNA polyerase)
	- `transcription`: DNA$$$\to$$$RNA (RNA polyerase)
	- `translation`: RNA$$$\to$$$protein (ribosome)



## The Cell
### cell theory
- all organisms are made of cells
- the cell is the simplest collection of matter that can be alive
- cell structure is correlated to cellular functions
- all cells are related by their descent from earlier cells

### cell characteristics
- basic features
	- plasma `membrane` (`selective permeability`)
	- semifluid `cytosol`
	- `chromosomes`
	- `ribosomes`

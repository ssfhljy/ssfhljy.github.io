	- Filipina domestic workers：
		- do everything
		- linked to their relationship with Philippine (world's labor exporter)
		- disempowered by gendered moral economy (family, religion, nationalism, economic competitiveness & entrepreneurship)

_"Labor Market Migrations: Immigrant Intersections in the Informal Economy"-Anna Joo Kim_

	- images/stereotypes: 
		- formal employment: better wages, avenues for promotion, fringe benefits (e.g. health care, paid vacations)
		- informal employment: limited upward mobility, lower wages, few/no fringe benefits, unlawful arrangements (e.g. working conditions)
		- exclusive boundaries between informal & formal labor market
	- NOT a fact (in densely populated `immigrant enclave`):
		- blur line between informal&formal sector
		- informal economy: part of world-wide economies, bind to formal economy, & higher rate in "Western" urbanized areas
		- workers are dynamic/unclear between two sectors
		- legal status not a major barrier to formal employment
		- informal wage offer higher pay & more flexibility
		- still some inflexible barriers: language abilities; legal status issue as double-edged sword; citizenship as mental/emotional strain; feel vulnerable.

	- economic restructuring: challenges to labor organizing
	- working-class labor organizing
		- emerged in the early 1990s
		- radical
		- roles/jobs (structural)
			- domestic work: static, private
			- taxi drivers: mobile, public
			- both heavily on immigrants, low paid, long hours, grueling conditions, high level of physical/psychological violence, gendered; 
			- rights of consumers are privileged over that of workers in both cases
			- neither centralized (more freedom?), but neither have the right to unionize (hard to organize movements)
			- both lack formal recognition for their workspaces (loophole for `abuse of power`)
		- why organized? working-class activists are strong in `action but not reflection`
		- strategies (How to)
			- dignify domestic work
			- emphasize collective actions
			- leadership
			- demonstrate in front of employers' homes (`undid boundaries between pubic and private`)
		- limitations
			- `little autonomy` (led to `dissolution`)
		- obstacles for employment
			- education
			- legal recognition
			- gender ideologies
			- mobilize: combine collective actions with legal service & job certification workshops
		- why domestic workers:
			- international economy
			- continuing restricting of U.S. economy: low-wage service jobs & high-skilled well paid job
			- exclusion of noncitizen
		- `double crisis`: a crisis in sustainability for certain sections of South Asian women; crisis in carrying out the work of social reproduction for mid-class families in U.S.
		- privatization state power: work authorization, exploitation making use of illegal status
		- drivers?
			- passenger entitlement
			- police brutality
			- NYTWA tactics:

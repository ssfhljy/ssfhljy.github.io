After several dates, my blog site finally get deployed on github pages with most basic features I need:

- clear and essay to use blog posting and processing system
- beautiful and neat UI
- in site search engine
- tagging and displaying tags
  

These all thanks to:
- convenient host by Github Pages
- bloging system by Jekyll
- advanced UI design by Zhangxin
- help from other nice bloggers

Still, Some functionalities have not been added:

- favicon (I don't know what's going on with the way I added it, it just simply does not work.) 
- commenting plugin (not so urgent, but still need to work on.)
- complete some static pages
- definitely, add some blogs now :-)
